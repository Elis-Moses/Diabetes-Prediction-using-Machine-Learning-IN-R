# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-IN-R

I built and compared two machine learning modelsâ€”Random Forest and Logistic Regressionâ€”to predict diabetes using patient data. The goal? To find the best-performing model that balances accuracy and interpretability.
I opted for Random Forest because:It captures complex non-linear relationships in the data and It provides feature importance, helping to identify the most influential factors in diabetes prediction.
Key Insights:
ðŸ”¹ Plasma Glucose and BMI are the top predictors of diabetes.
ðŸ”¹ Fine-tuning Random Forest improved performance, making it a strong choice for medical predictions.
ðŸ”¹ Feature correlation analysis helped reduce multicollinearity and improve model stability.
